## Welcome

This is my ePortfolio for CS-499. I presently have three artifacts available for view at each of the below links:

- [whoami](./whoami/)
- [Zoo Monitoring System](./monitoring-system/)
- [gas](./gas/)

I've also included a [video code review](./CodeReview.mp4) regarding my process for updating and polishing each project.

## Self-evaluation
