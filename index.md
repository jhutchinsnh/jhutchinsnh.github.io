## Welcome

This is my ePortfolio for CS-499. I presently have three artifacts available for view at each of the below links:

- [whoami](./whoami/) ([code](https://github.com/jhutchinsnh/jhutchinsnh.github.io/blob/master/whoami/))
- [Zoo Monitoring System](./monitoring-system/) ([code](https://github.com/jhutchinsnh/jhutchinsnh.github.io/blob/master/monitoring-system/))
- [gas](./gas/) ([code](https://github.com/jhutchinsnh/jhutchinsnh.github.io/blob/master/gas/))

I've also included a [video code review](./CodeReview.mp4) regarding my process for updating and polishing each project.
