## Welcome

This is my ePortfolio for CS-499. I presently have three artifacts available for view at each of the below links:

- [whoami](./whoami/) ([code](https://github.com/jhutchinsnh/jhutchinsnh.github.io/blob/master/whoami/))
- [Zoo Monitoring System](./monitoring-system/) ([code](https://github.com/jhutchinsnh/jhutchinsnh.github.io/blob/master/monitoring-system/))
- [gas](./gas/) ([code](https://github.com/jhutchinsnh/jhutchinsnh.github.io/blob/master/gas/))

I've also included a [video code review](./CodeReview.mp4) regarding my process for updating and polishing each project.

## Self-evaluation

This ePortfolio for my Computer Science Capstone really emphasizes some of my strongest suits in programming: identifying and replacing bad code, iterating further on good code, and employing newer technologies like Docker to enhance and innovate on existing projects. I’ve always had an eye for detail, and these artifacts allowed me to show off my ability to find trouble spots and rewrite them for efficiency and functionality, like adding a system service for the whoami script to replace a foreground process.

When it comes to working with others, I’ve been involved in collaborative team environments for more than fifteen years, as subordinate, colleague, mentor, and subject-matter expert. I’ve learned that code review sessions are vital to familiarity with all parts of a project, and that blame and shame have no place in an effective work environment. Furthermore, communicating with stakeholders comes easily when you treat each project as a problem to be solved efficiently, without ego and office politics, seeking the best courses of action that will produce the best results regardless of source.

Regarding data structures and algorithms, it’s important to design each project with efficiency in mind, while leaving the door open for modular improvements down the road. If you know a feature could be requested in the future, it’s best to shape the code in a way for easy addition later, even if you don’t have the time or resources at the moment. Similarly, in software engineering and database design, this can elevate a project’s utility to its stakeholders; thinking ahead and exploring each use case thoroughly will help anticipate a client’s needs before they ask, like when the Zoo Monitoring System specifications forgot to ask for ways to modify the fields they were keen on displaying.

Lastly, yet most importantly, security is of paramount importance. It’s more than just using a strong password with strong cryptography; in addition to overall vigilance – such as keeping abreast of new CVEs and learning new techniques to avoid pitfalls – one should always be asking, “How can this be misused by accident or on purpose?” While designing any system, no matter how benign, it’s important to understand the possible impact on your infrastructure and customers if something were to go awry, such as a flooded API or a crashed website caused by excessive database hits. On the latter, I’ve used a hybrid of SQL requests and local objects to reduce database reads and writes unless changes occur in both the Gas and Monitoring System programs; while low usage would make this redundant, programming it now would help prevent load issues in the future.

To demonstrate the skills I’ve learned throughout my time at SNHU, I’ve chosen three artifacts for improvement and added them here. The whoami script demonstrates software design, and my desire to iterate on good code; while serviceable, I wanted to improve the program with the knowledge I’ve gained in the intervening years since it was written. The Zoo Monitoring Service script demonstrates my ability to enhance a program with newer technologies and database software, replacing a system run on employee sticky notes with a Dockerized MySQL server. Finally, the gas script displays algorithms and data structure by rewriting a program from the ground-up in another language to provide a working, useful application.
